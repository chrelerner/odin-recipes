    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Chi chi dango, a mochiko dessert confection, is a soft, chewy Japanese treat that is very similar in taste to mochi.
        It's traditionally served at Girl's Day or Boy's Day celebrations.
        It makes a great snack for picnics or parties.
        This recipe is easy to make, but don't double the directions â€” follow them exactly as written.
